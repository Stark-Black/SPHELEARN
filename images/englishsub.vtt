00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
when I was 21 I took a flight to the US

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to spend some time with my

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
boyfriend when my dad dropped me off at

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the airport he went into full parenting

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
mode fussing and worrying over me he

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
told the man at check-in that I'd only

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
been on short flights before the crew

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
member told him not to worry and that

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'd be well looked after and he told me

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to wait on some chairs near security I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
did so and a bit later I was escorted

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
onto the plane in a car I was the first

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
on the plane and I saw that there was a

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
coloring pack on my seat which I thought

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
was a bit odd I was about to ask a cabin

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
crew member about it but they were busy

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with the other passengers who were all

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
queuing and boarding after being cramped

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
on a coach a bit later I was asked if I

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
wanted to go up to the cockpit to see

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the pilot and I did it was there that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the captain asked me how old I was he

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
got a bit of a surprise when I told him

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that's when I realized that my dad had

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
made them think I needed special

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
treatment as a minor it was

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
hilarious

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I was on a flight from India to the USA

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
with a stopover in Dubai I was just

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
boarding when I saw someone I recognized

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but he was in a wheelchair which was odd

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
because I had always known him as a fit

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and healthy guy it was curious but I

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
didn't know him well so I decided not to

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
get into conversation with him he might

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
not be in the mood for small talk if he

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
was under the weather I didn't see him

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
during the flight I think he was in

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
first class at Dubai I saw him again

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
being wheeled through security while I

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
was queuing up and then I saw him again

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
after we arrived and that's when he

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
noticed me and gave me a cheery wave it

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
was about a week later when I saw him in

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the park I couldn't believe my eyes he

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
was jogging I couldn't understand how

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
he'd made such a fast recovery anyway he

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
spotted me and jogged up to me and we

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
got chatting it turned out that there

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
was no injury at all he just bought

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
himself a fake doctor's certificate so

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that he could pass as a wheelchair

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
passenger and get special treatment

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
apparently it's common

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I was 13 years old when I took

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
a flight to London with my mom neither

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
of us had been on a plane before so we

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
were excited but nervous we knew that we

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
had to get to the airport 3 hours before

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
our flight took off but what we thought

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
was the check-in time was actually the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
departure time so when we arrived at the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
airport the flight was already boarding

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the lady told us not to worry we

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
wouldn't miss our flight but there were

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
only two seats left one in the middle

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and one at the back we were so

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
disappointed I didn't want to sit away

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
from my mom because I was nervous about

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
flying and she wanted to sit with me

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
because she doesn't speak English the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
lady must have seen my face because she

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
said don't worry I can sit you together

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
she printed out our boarding cards and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
we ran to the gate when we boarded we

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
turned towards economy class and the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
flight attendant told us we were going

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the wrong way the lady at the desk had

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
put us in business class so that we

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
could sit together it was so comfortable

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and we got all kinds of extra treats I

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
only wish I'd realized sooner and had

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
thanked that lady properly
